# voting-app-back-end

This is the back-end of the voting app, this API is developed with Node, express, typescript and graphQL.

To run this part of the application the following steps must be followed:

1. Download/clone the project locally with Git Clone.
2. Once downloaded go to the voting-app-back-end folder and there run the npm install script to install all the dependencies. 
3. Then run the npm run dev script.
4. IMPORTANT: then in another tab of the terminal go to the same folder and run npm run seed (This is to fill the database. You must have SQLite installed on the computer).
5. OPTIONAL: To verify that the server started, go to localhost:3001/graphql .

Ready it is running, now we must go to the front-end repository.
